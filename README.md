# Crowd Check: Library Occupancy and Resource Management Application

Crowd Check is an Android application designed to streamline the library experience for Adamson University students. The app provides real-time library occupancy data, manages book borrowing and returns, and integrates features to enhance collaboration and resource utilization.

## Key Features
- **Occupancy Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of library capacity using RFID-based scanning, providing users with timely updates to optimize their visit schedules.
- **Book Management System:** Seamless borrowing and returning of books, complete with due-date reminders to encourage timely returns.
- **User Collaboration Tools:** A "Find Friend" feature that helps users identify and connect with peers in the library.

## Technical Highlights
- **Data Management:** Designed and implemented a hierarchical Firebase Realtime Database to manage user data, book inventories, and occupancy metrics, ensuring scalability and efficient data queries.
- **Agile Development:** Assigned tasks and coordinated team efforts using an agile methodology to deliver key features effectively, including real-time occupancy tracking and feedback collection.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Frontend Development:** Android Studio and Java.
  - **Database Management:** Firebase Realtime Database with JSON-based schema for optimized data storage and retrieval.
  - **Hardware Integration:** Arduino-powered RFID scanning system for seamless library access and occupancy updates.
